The usage of Neural Networks has been steadily increasing over time. With a multitude of papers being published every year, Deep Learning has found its applications in many fields of our daily lives - ranging from recommedation systems and personalization to medical diagnosis and healthcare. A recently popularised area of applying these techniques is for content generation.  Text Generation, the most commonly seen form of this has become a ubiquitous feature in recent years. Auto-complete features in our message apps, emails and even Google searches is a common and helpful application of this. The model on the backend inputs and processes the initial few words typed by us and predicts the next most probable word from its vocabulary. The user has an option to use this word or continue typing, either of which further trains the model as it learns from the actual next word.  An attempt along a similar philosophy can be made to train a neural network to generate music, and this is indeed becoming popular in recent years. Here I build a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in Python using Keras, to generate piano music.
